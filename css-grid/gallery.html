        <p  class="left">So far in our 2023 season we are 14-0 (wins and losses). We haven't allowed more than 8 points in a game and have won
            a tournament called Seattle Invite. Winning Seattle Invite earned us an invite back to the High School National Invite (HSNI) for the 3rd staight year.
            Our team is captained by Syon Rao (me) and Axel Olson, they have been captians since their junior year and they are currently seniors. The Eagles
            are 2 wins away from their 3rd straight league championship and 3rd straight state playoff berth. We hope to be able to win back to back state championships
            which would be the second state championship in our schools' history. The Eagles have a roster of 28 guys who are all working their butts off to win everything there is to win. Wish us 
            luck on the rest of the year! ROLL PREP.

        <div class="grid-item main2"> <h2>Team Culture</h2>
            <p class="left">An essential part of our team is our team culture. We start and end every practice by saying Eagles on 3 and family on 6. Our team isn't just team but also a family. We are a band of 
                brothers who will go to any measure to protect each other. The feeling of our team being a family is what drives us forward and makes us work so hard for each other. 
            The coaches push us to always be go into every game together and come out of it together no matter what. We all have each others backs no matter what. Something Mr. Waltzer
        always tells us is "the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack." </p>

        <div class="grid-item support2"> <h2> Jersey Design</h2> 
        <p>
            We have two jerseys a white and a black one. Our white jersey was inspired by the gradient of the night sky. It starts off in a deep blue and fades into white. These are one of my
            favorite jerseys but my favorite is the black jersey. Our black jersey has the topography of Kirkland on it. This hidden meaning makes the jersey mean so much more to me as it is our school's hometown. 
            The design also looks so so sick.
