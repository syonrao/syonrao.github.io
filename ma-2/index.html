        <div class="grid-item main1"> <h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-decoration: underline">The Importance of Mental Health</h2><p>Student mental health is a pressing issue in today's educational system. Students are suffering from anxiety and stress at a higher rate than every before and schools aren't doing enough to support their students. As students are progressing through high schools 
            into high grade levels they are being assigned a higher work load which in turn is resulting in more stress and anxiety. Student mental health is worsening as each year passes. More than 60% of college students are experiencing or have experienced at least 1 mental health condition. In 2021, 42% of high schoolers felt persistently sad and 29% experienced poor mental health. 
            The demand for counseling is at an all time high among students, if this isn't a cry for help then I don't know what is anymore. Thankfully, it isn't all bad. Schools and universities are taking measures to improve student well-being. In response to growing mental health concerns during the pandemic, 67% of schools reported increasing mental health services offered to students.
            Mental health is a complex problem that we are still grasping with today. We can do our part by supporting each other and holding each other up in times of need. This website will highlight ways that you can get help at EPS and shed light on things that cause students stress.
